<p>I hopped around between so many different note taking solutions as a college freshman I knew every service and application available, however none satisfied my need. Essentially what I was looking for was <strong>a drop-dead simple way for taking textual notes</strong>. I soon came to realize that what I needed out of a notes system was <strong>2 interactions</strong>:</p>

<p>The first interaction would be <strong>taking the notes themselves</strong>. Around the time I built Markdown Tree I had become quite accustomed to VIMâ€™s modal editing and I felt that I was a lot faster in VIM than any other interface. Thus, I needed a markup language to work with inside of VIM with. I chose Markdown as it was the most straightforward and simplistic solution I could find.</p>

<p>The second interaction would be <strong>displaying the notes</strong>. I wanted a way to display the notes on multiple devices of different sizes. A web interface was the most logical solution. I knew that I could work the CSS so that my notes would look good on any device. From there it was just a matter of figuring out how to get my Markdown notes in hierarchy structure to render as HTML.</p>

<h3 id="default_template">Default Template</h3>

<p>The default template has a navigation bar at top, the content, and a footer on each page. The navigation bar looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/markdown-tree-nav.png" alt="Markdown Tree Navigation" /></p>

<p>I also wanted to stay with a simplistic style for my content elements. Hierarchical structure within lists was important for me. Thus:</p>

<p><img src="/images/markdown-tree-list.png" alt="Markdown Tree Navigation" /></p>

<p>As for the footer, it would be purely functional. Tell me when the page was generated and let me validate if need be.</p>

<h3 id="technical_details">Technical Details</h3>

<p>Sinatra was an quite ideal solution. Sinatra is a ruby library that gives you a simple method of creating web applications. Also Red Carpet, included with Sinatra, gave me a way to render Markdown! All I needed was the logic of the application and it was done. All said and done the whole thing (the ruby/logic) came out only 70 lines!</p>
