In late November I wound up making my primary laptop un-bootable. I started using a Thinkpad X40 running off a CF card as my primary machine.  With all my luck my USB-Sata adapter also broke and I lost userbound.com's [Jekyll]() folder because it lived on a SATA drive laptop I once booted from. However, I've got good news: I've finally recovered that Jekyll folder!  Thus, I'm back. I've put the source to [userbound.com](http://userbound.com) on Github so this kind of thing doesn't happen again.

On a seperate note.. While looking over my Jekyll folder for this site I realized: Jekyll is way too much. I'm soon going to be switching this site off of Jekyll for something lighter sometime soon. But it's break now, so I'm hacking on a few other projects. Stay tuned, I've got some good stuff in the pipeline. Did you miss me, good reader?
