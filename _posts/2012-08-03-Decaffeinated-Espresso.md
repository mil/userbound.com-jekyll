title: Decaffeinated Espresso
time: 11:02PM

Who walks into a coffee shop at 1:14PM on a Thursday, walks up to the counter, and asks for a decaffeinated espresso? When I was sitting in the cafe enjoying my coffee, and I heard this lady place her order it pained me.

Usually the decision others make don't bother me, but why would you honestly have a desire for decaffeinated espresso at 1:14PM on a Thursday. Or, why would you ever have a desire for a decaffeinated espresso? It just makes no sense to me. Drinking a decaffeinated espresso goes against everything espresso stands for. I have not a clue.
