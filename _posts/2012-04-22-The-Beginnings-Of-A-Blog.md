title: The Beginnings Of A Blog 
time: 2:12AM

For a long time I have considered blogging and I've finally now decided to start. I also needed a place to host some projects so I figured it was a good time. This site will mainly exist to keep a log for myself through coding, design, and day to day life. Who knows maybe some things I talk about here will help others, at least that's my hope.

In any case, a little bit about this blog&hellip; I wound up using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for generating the pages to be served in static form. Jekyll does a bit more than I would like it to, however it's the best of the alternatives I found. Also it is very well documented so that's good. Further, the posts for the blog section have a very minimal header such that my posts in Markdown could easily be ported to another system if so needed (or I build my own generator).

As for the design, I had a rough idea of what I wanted this site to look like, however the design was largely influenced by creating the markup implementing the basic features I thought I'd need of this site. All pages are validated XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS2.1. 

The site is not fully complete, however I tried to bring it up to minimum viability for its purpose. There are a few additional things I'd like to add such as a commenting system. However, if I add a commenting system I won't want to use Disqus or another service-based solution. As it stands now this site is completely independent of any sort of external services and that's the way I'd like for it to stay. I'd like to find something to use similar to Disqus only open source that I can host it myself. Anyway feel free to poke around this site, I'll be posting new entries to the blog every few days and updating the projects section from time to time as well.
