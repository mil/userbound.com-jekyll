## Mil <span class="small">(Miles Sandlar)</span>
I'd best label myself as a **minimalist hacker**. I do a little bit of everything from design to code. Basically, I just like trying to figure out how to make life and software simpler. I'm currently an undergraduate student at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu). I'm not sure what my formal degree will be in yet but I enjoy: **Psychology**, **Philosophy**, **Industrial Design**, and **Logic**.

I have a lot of software interests, most of which revolve around minimalism and usability. My biggest technical interests currently are in: **C**, **Io**, and **Ruby**. I'm also big advocate of **\*NIX** for personal and desktop use. I'm currently working on building a window manager for X called [Foo WM](http://github.com/mil/foo-wm).

What do I do besides software? I run the **Poker Club** at Virginia Tech, I listen to a lot of **Funk** and **Jazz** music, and I play **Bass Guitar**.

If you want to get in touch feel free to shoot me an email at miles@&#91;this domain&#93;. You can also find me on the web at [GitHub](http://github.com/mil) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/sandlar).

Userbound.com is the site you're looking at right now. It's named Userbound in the idea that I talk about software that is *bound* for the *user*.  I mainly use this site to host to my projects and writings. Most of my projects and writings are on software interests.
