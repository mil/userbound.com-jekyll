  <p><h2>Hi I'm Miles</h2> I'd consider myself somewheere in between  a developer and a designer. My knowledge ranges from the C Xlib Library to Browser Based Responsive. In my past I've previously done freelancing work in the domain of Front-End web design and development. I have lots of technical intrests  and design interests cenetered understanding the user, however that's defined.  Here's my formal <a href="#">resume</a>.</p>

  <p>About to graduate from Virginia Tech with Psychology and Philosophy degrees and an Industrial Design minor, I'm actively searching for work in front-end shop work: markup creation, styling, templates, user interface design/dev, that sort of thing.</p>
