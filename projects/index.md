## Personal Projects
Below are writeups for some of my projects. I use this area for discussing the rationale (from a usability and pragmatic view) of each project. Accompanying source for each project can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mil).

### [Keyboard Tiler](/projects/keyboard-tiler)

Look down at your keyboard and consider the grid of keys from **1** down to **Z** over to **/**, and up to **0**. Yeah, that's a 4x10 grid, giving you 40 tiles to arrange windows. This is a script to take in any two keys and position the window on those tiles. Feed that into a chorded keymap program and you're set.

### [Markdown Tree](/projects/markdown-tree)

Why would I generate static pages for a simple hierarchy site for personal use? It's an extra un-necessary step for the level scale of a simple user's everyday usecase. Instead, how about a site that solely transverses a directory of Markdown files and serves each file with a common template including navigation.

Imagine if  a web browser allowed you to see and talk with other people on the same page as you. Every user would be represted by an animated character and you could literally follow others through the Internet. When you clicked on a link your character would actually jump up and into the link.
