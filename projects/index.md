## Interface Design Projects
Below are writeups for some of my interfaces I make. I use this area for discussing the rationale (from a usability and pragmatic view) of each project. Accompanying source for each project can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mil).



<hr class="project" />

### [Mil Edit](/ui/mil-edit)
<a href="/ui/mil-edit" title="Mil Edit"><img src="/images/mil-edit.png" alt="Mil Edit" class='project-image' /></a>
A new kind of way to edit Markdown lists in the browser. An alternative to invalid-markup-generating WYSIYG editors. Solid keybindings, import and export markdown functions. Buttons and keybindings call same set of functions.

### [Foo Window Manger](http://github.com/mil/foo-wm)
<a href="http://github.com/mil/foo-wm" title="Keyboard Tiler"><img src="/images/foo-wm.png" alt="Keyboard Tiler" class='project-image' /></a>
My most prolific project to date, foo-wm is a minimalistic window manager for X11 that: organize all windows in a tree and provides a simple DSL for transversing and manipulating the tree. This is my primary window manager on a day to day basis.

### [MTA Subway CLI](https://github.com/jns2/mta-subway-cli)
<a href="https://github.com/jns2/mta-subway-cli" title="Keyboard Tiler"><img src="/images/mta-subway-cli.png" alt="Keyboard Tiler" class='project-image' /></a>
During my time at [Hackerschool](http://hackerschool.com), while living in NYC, I became quite acquainted with riding the subways. This is a small CLI that I and [Arjan Sign](http://github.com/jns2) made to determine MTA Subway departure times given any station.

### [Keyboard Tiler](/projects/keyboard-tiler)
<a href="/projects/keyboard-tiler" title="Keyboard Tiler"><img src="/images/grid-wm.jpg" alt="Keyboard Tiler" class='project-image' /></a>
Look down at your keyboard and consider the grid of keys from **1** down to **Z** over to **/**, and up to **0**. Yeah, that's a 4x10 grid, giving you 40 tiles to arrange windows. This is a script to take in any two keys and position the window on those tiles. Feed that into a chorded keymap program and you're set.

### [Markdown Tree](/projects/markdown-tree)
<a href="/projects/markdown-tree" title="Markdown Tree"><img src="/images/markdown-tree.jpg" alt="Markdown Tree" class='project-image' /></a>
Why would I generate static pages for a simple hierarchy site for personal use? It's an extra un-necessary step for the level scale of a simple user's everyday usecase. Instead, how about a site that solely transverses a directory of Markdown files and serves each file with a common template including navigation.

### [Userbound](/projects/userbound)
<a href="/projects/userbound" title="Userbound"><img src="/images/userbound.png" alt="Userbound" class='project-image' /></a>
Imagine if  a web browser allowed you to see and talk with other people on the same page as you. Every user would be represted by an animated character and you could literally follow others through the Internet. When you clicked on a link your character would actually jump up and into the link.
